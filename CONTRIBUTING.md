## Creating Issues
When you create issues, please use standard open-source etiquette. Simply:
- Use labels 
- Use descriptive on-topic titles
- Structure the issue body with a description, request details and reasoning, or in the case of bugs or requests, expected results and actual results.

## Pull Requests
When creating pull requests, again, please use standard open-source etiquette.
- Use descriptive on-topic titles
- Reference the issue it addresses/resolves
- Give a description of the pull request contents

## Source Conventions
If you have suggestions to improve the best-practice conventions for the project technology, please open an issue and reference the part of the project you feel could be improved. Please include links to resources stating the correct styles/conventions.

## Git
When creating branches, please follow the below naming scheme.
```
<issue-number>-<branch-type>-<summary>
```

When commiting to the project, please follow the below structure such that the commit summary can complete the statement _"If applied, this commit will..."_
```
Add ...
Update ...
Remove ...
Refactor ...
Fix ...
Release ...
```
This is a brief summary, but, for a more in-depth guide on creating consistently great git commits, check out [Chris Beams' _"How to Write a Git Commit Message"_](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) blog post which is my preferred method of using git in all projects.
